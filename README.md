# mdbook-template

Yield a mdbook demo with [mdbook-theme](https://github.com/zjp-CN/mdbook-theme)
and a yml file for github action automation and page publication.

You just need to creat md files in `src/` dir, then add the filenames in `SUMMARY.md`,
and everything is ready to go.

But for the first time after pushing to github, set the source of github page to 
`gh-pages` branch and `/(root)` in `Settings`.

Have fun with mdbook!
